# CS202 HW3

## Problem 1

### 1.(a)

    max(200ps, 170ps, 220ps, 210ps, 150ps) = 220ps
    sum(200ps, 170ps, 220ps, 210ps, 150ps) = 950ps

    the clock cycle in a pipeline processor = 220ps
    the clock cycle in a non-pipeline processor = 950ps

### 1.(b)

    the total latency of an LW instruction in a pipelined processor = 5 * 220ps = 1100ps
    the total latency of an LW instruction in a non-pipelined processor = 950ps

### 1.(c)

    I will split that of EX
    new clock cycle time of the processor = max(200ps, 170ps, 110ps, 210ps, 150ps) = 210ps

### 1.(d)

    Since only LW and SW are involved in MEM, the utilisation rate is 15% + 15% = 30%

### 1.(e)

    Since only ALU and LW are involved in that of the "Registers" unit, the utilisation rate is 55% + 15% = 70%

### 1.(f)

1. Single-cycle

        clock cycle time = 950ps
        execution time = 1 * 950ps = 950ps

2. multi-cycle

        clock cycle time = 220ps
        execution time = (0.55 * 4 + 0.15 * 3 + 0.15 * 5 + 0.15 * 4) * 220 = (2.2 + 1.8) * 220 = 880ps

3. pipelined organization

        clock cycle time = 220ps
        execution time = (4 + n) / n * 220ps -> 1 * 220ps = 220ps

In summary (when n -> infinite):

        Single-cycle = 4.3 * pipelined-organization
        multi-cyle = 4 * pipelined-organization

## Problem 2

### 2.(a)

    the one without forwarding = (n + 5*n) * 250ps = 1500n ps
    the one with forwarding = (n + 0.05n) * 275ps = 288.75n ps
    Speed up = 1500n / 288.75n ~= 5.20

### 2.(b)

    ((n + 5n) * 250ps - n * 275ps)/275ps ~= 4n

## Problem 3 (does NOT handle data hazards =>  does NOT support forwarding)

### 3.(a)

    add x5, x2, x1
    nop
    nop
    nop
    lw x6, 4(x5)
    lw x2, 0(x2)
    add x3, x5, x1
    nop
    nop
    nop
    sw x3, 0(x5)

    total number of clock cycles required = (5 -1) + 11 = 15

### 3.(b)

    add x5, x2, x1
    lw x2, 0(x2)
    nop
    nop
    add x3, x5, x1
    lw x6, 4(x5)
    nop
    nop
    sw x3, 0(x5)

    total number of clock cycles required = (5 - 1) + 9 = 13
